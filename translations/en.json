It is a comprehensive application with both <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">frontend and backend</span> interfaces, accompanied by an<span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\"> administrator's backoffice</span>. I dedicated five months to its completion, and this project provided me with a tangible insight into the developer's profession.",
    "p2_quaiAntique": "For its realization, I chose to use <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">React.js and Node.js</span>, as they were the technologies I was most proficient in. I began by designing <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">all screens</span>, both for <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">desktop and mobile, using Figma</span>, allowing me to visualize my site. Following this, I created use case <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\"> diagrams and a conceptual data model (CDM)</span> to understand and define the database and site functionalities.",

While this project presented a considerable <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">challenge</span>, it was highly <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">educational</span>. It also sparked a commitment to continuous improvement and a realization that <span class=\"fw-bolder text-fort\">there is still much for me to learn</span> and refine in my journey as a developer. I continue to enhance it, as there is much more to do.",
